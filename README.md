A classic game of Snake
Thanks to Ania Kubow from freeCodeCamp.org for the tutorial on building a classic Snake game.
I made the grid 14x14 instead of 10x10, added background styling and instructions.
I also made the game responsive with buttons for use on mobile. I had the buttons working
with 4 functions, one for each direction. I found another tutorial from Fakorede Damilola,
also from freeCodeCamp.org that was seemingly almost the same that showed a better method
for combining the functions right into the eventListeners. Thanks to Fakorede as well.
